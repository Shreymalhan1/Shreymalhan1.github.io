## What is GitHub?

<img  src="gitLogopng.png" alt="GitHub logo">

[Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E&ab_channel=GitHub) is a code sharing and publishing platform which can connect people and facilitate them to work on a problem together from anywhere in the world. Github uses a feature called **Version Control** which keeps track of all the changes you or the other developers make on the project.

The three features of GitHub `fork, pull request and merge` are what make GitHub so powerful. *Fork* is coping a repository from one user's account to another. Then you can modify that repository under your own account. If you would like to share your changes, you can create a *pull request* for the original owner of the repo. That user can then *merge* the changes found in your repo with the original repo.

## What is MarkDown?

</br>[Markdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f49LJV1i-_w&ab_channel=Codecademy) is a lightweight markup language to add formating elements to plain text and making writing for the internet easier. It has been widely adopted by the developers because it does not take long to learn the [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) and can be used for everything. 
Infact, I used MarkDown to create this README file and the resume which I am hosting in this repository.

### Lets Get Started

Signing up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) could not have been any simpler. You just need a username,email and password and you are all set to explore the GitHub world.

#### 3. Adding theme to the file
You can add a theme to your GitHub Pages site to customize your site’s look and feel.This can be done by adding a [Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) theme to your repository.  

* Under your repository name, click `Settings`.
* Under GitHub Pages, click `Choose a theme`.
* Choose the theme you like and then click `Select theme`.

A new file, `_config.yml` should be created in your repo which store all the Jekyll commands.

### FAQ
**Why is markdown better than a word processor?**

Markdown have features like **version control** which helps you track all the changes made to the project my different group members, whereas, in word documents it is imposible to merge or keep a track of changes  

**How can I change the description of my repository?**

On the right side of the screen, there will be an `about` section which display the description of the repository. By clicking `⚙️` present on the right side if the section, you can change the desription.
